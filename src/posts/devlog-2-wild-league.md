Hey, welcome to the second devlog of this wild league series.

![](/posts/initial-page-wild-league.png)

So in the previous devlog I talked about the whole idea of this project and what I plan for this game

While I'm the only working in this project, I talk with my friends and other people a lot trying to get new ideas and also
because I want someone else opinion.

In one of this conversations, I was asked why I was thinking about the map on vertical and why not horizonatal, but I never imagined doing
it horizontally, (as a someone who have been playing clash royale for about ~7 years) I was so used to the vertical map, that I didn't stop to see other options.

There are some points to mention here about this (180 deg) change:
- I'm doing it in pixel art, so doing it on a horizontal map it's way more natural than vertical
- The game is focused to desktop, so I can also take advantage of the size screen in a horizontal map

Just to not let this post get so longer, and point what I did this week:

- I fixed the save method, so know the nickname and level is being saved correctly
- I change the sprites and made animations work horizontally instead of vertically
- I defined the base attributes of the cards and also defined the user props (e.g.: list of decks)

That's all, thank you if you read this far.

On the next devlog I'll talk about the base properties of the cards and about some decisions I have been thinking about mechanincs and etc.
