Hey, welcome to the first devlog about wild league.

I've been working on this game for about the last month, and I have to be honest that not so much work has been done _yet_, still, I want to start the devlog so I can keep a changelog and start sharing my project with you.

# Overview
This game is basically an attempt to create a "Clash Royale"-like game focused on desktop (at this moment).

The game will keep the cards and decks idea and will focus on strategy.

Just to give some context, I've been playing clash royale since the first release and I still play this game daily, so I'm a big fan of this game, but the Wild League project is meant to increase some features and focus more in a community project.

By this time the project is open source and you can see on [github](https://github.com/ropoko/wild-league/).

# About the techs being used
I'm currently using Lua + Love2D and the game style at this moment is pixel art.

All the sprites being used is free and will have the credits properly mentioned.

As I said above, at this time the project is open-source and my plans is to keep as it is, feel free to contribute if you sympathize with this project, by this time I'm the only working on this project and any help will be _**really**_ appreciated.

# About the community thing
About what I said of being a "community project", I mean that the project is being built planning that things like:

- improvements on the game
- mods
- balancing the game and cards

All this will be done by the community for the community (please Razer sponsor me).

# Planning
In the next weeks I plan to continue working in the card feature and fix some things in the map.

I know what you're thinking, "how do I know what you done if you didn't say anything?", but this you'll know in the next devlog by the end of this week.

Thank you if you read this far.
