# Thoughts

I really like to see side-B things, or things that aren't famous at all, and by this, personally, it's not because I want to look different, but purely to see things that aren't in the mainstream.

## Community
When you start keeping up with a project that isn't famous and it's in the very beginning, you'll be closer the community and your contributions (if you do), will be more valuable than in a big project.

People that maintain the project (usually) will be more inclined to be gentle if you have some question, etc. That's because there are not many info out there to help you out, so with your question, the maintainers can learn how to be more precise in docs and faqs, and this is specially great during the initial phase of some project, where you're still confuse about the path you want to follow.

Just to clarify (in case it wasn't), you of course can (and should) contribute to big projects and any project you want and your contribution will be worth and very valuable for the project, but my point here is that, based in the size, your contrib. in smaller projects you'll be more valuable and so your influence.
